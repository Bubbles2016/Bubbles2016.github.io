			<h2>Passion for Dentistry since 1977</h2>
			<hr/>
			<p>Khoury Dental Clinic saw the light in 1977, when Professor Hani Khoury returned to Lebanon from France, after finishing his specialty in gum and bone disease, also known as “periodontics”.

			Dr. Hani is one of the founding members of the Department of “Periodontology and Dental Implants” at Saint Joseph University in Beirut.

We are one of the FIRST clinics to place dental implants in Lebanon, starting the early 1990s.

			</p>
			<p>Pr. Hani always believed that the solutions in oral care require the expertise of multiple specialties. For this reason, our staff is made up of several talented and multi-specialized Lebanese dentists, including Orthodontists, Periodontists, Implantologists, Oral Surgeons, Prosthodontists and Endodontists that work together to create first class results.

It was in 2006 that Dr. Jeff Khoury joined his father at Khoury Dental Clinic. Graduating from Saint Joseph University, Jeff holds a double specialty degree in “Gum & Bone Disease and Dental Implants“ as well as in “TMJ Disorders” which focuses on facial muscle pain, joint clicking and bad malocclusion.

At Khoury Dental Clinic, our dentists are dedicated to providing our customers with the most advanced standards in modern dentistry. With three high-tech operating units and four friendly dental assistants, we will receive you at the earliest convenience in a relaxed and hygienic environment that will make you feel safe and comfortable.

We hope we’ll have the pleasure to meet you soon.
